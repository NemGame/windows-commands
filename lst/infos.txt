File names and source code includes swearing
I used MinGW to build
lst.c - main file, build this
printfw.h - one of my libraries, it's used for actually writing to the terminal in Unicode (dependency)

Binary: lst.exe

Stuff:
FUCK.c - the save beforce implementing Unicode
a.exe - an older build
build.bat - just builds and runs the file
update.bat - builds the file and copies it to the directory above
dir/ - a directory
fájl.txt - Unicode name file (fájl means "file" in Hungarian)
